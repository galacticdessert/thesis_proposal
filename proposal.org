* Introduction
Internal combustion engines are still the most widely adopted powertrain for on-road vehicles. However, due to inefficiencies in the energy conversion process, around 60-70% of the fuel energy is wasted: approximately 40% of the fuel energy leaves the engine in the hot exhaust and another 30% is lost as heat. In order to achieve significant efficiency improvements, recovery of waste heat from exhaust gases and/or other high energy streams may be performed.

* Thesis proposal
My thesis is focused on comparing three different technologies that aim at recovering waste heat produced by the ICE.

Different configurations will be compared, in particular two different Organic Rankine bottoming cycles paired with an Otto-cycle engine, and a split-cycle engine with isothermal compression and integrated waste heat recovery. The comparison will be carried out via Matlab/Simulink simulations.

The powertrain model that will be used is backward-looking, this means that the torque demand is computed from the velocity speed profile. The model will take as input the velocity profile of a driving cycle for which experimental data is available, then the torque and angular speed at the engine will be calculated through a simulated transmission. Furthermore, engine maps will be extracted from experimental data along with characteristics and performances of the heat exchangers, making possible the calculation of flow rate, temperature and heat flux for both the exhaust gases and the coolant. Once the waste heat data will be available, the bottoming cycle model will be introduced. Starting from the output of the powertrain model, the recovered energy and produced power will be calculated.

** IC-engine with Organic Rankine bottoming cycle
The first system that will be studied is the well known IC-cycle engine paired with a bottoming Organic Rakine cycle. This system has been studied and tested extensively since the '70s, and there are commercial available products in the heavy-duty market that adopt it. The aforementioned powertrain model has to be built to perform the desired analysis on this configuration, and will constitute the starting point for the more following cases.

This powertrain will constitute the "baseline" scenario for the comparison, due to the already discussed diffusion and universal acceptance as a valid waste heat recovery method.

- *Modeling methodology and assumptions*
The powertrain model will be built starting from previous projects which focused on similar topics, and will be adapted for the particular case considered. The gasoline engine that will be modeled is a 3.6L V6, for which recorded data is available. As a waste heat source, only the heat coming from the exhaust gases will be used for recuperation, neglecting the heat contained in the coolant. The coolant heat recovery shows additional complexities due to lower exergetic content. Being this the baseline scenario, it has been decided to stick to the most common configuration, that is without the coolant heat recovery.

- *Expected results*
The results expected should be coherent with the majority of the studies that can be found in literature, that is an expected increase in the global engine efficiency around 3-7% on average drive-cycle.

** IC-engine with evaporative cooling Organic Rankine bottoming cycle
The previous system will be  modified in order to remove the heat exchanger between the heat source and the cycle working fluid. This way the ORC working fluid will replace the engine coolant, increasing the amount of energy recovered and reducing the heat and the number of components of the system. This setup is different from the simple coolant heat recovery, as it allows to have access to a higher temperature heat source, while replacing the regular engine coolant.

As a downside, the control system will become more complex, because it is necessary to control the refrigerant mass flow rate to guarantee the required cooling for the engine at all the operating points, while not having vapor phase in the engine cooling piping. Furthermore, modeling heat transfer during nucleate boiling is considered a major challenge for this task.

- *Modeling methodology and assumptions*
The model used for the first case will be used as starting point, but it will be modified accordingly to the new configuration. Variable flow rate pumps will be implemented, and a control system for assuring the correct cooling of the engine will be necessary. The fluid entering the engine will be assumed as saturated liquid, while the superheating will be performed in a heat exchanger using the heat from the exhaust gases.

- *Expected results*
It's expected an increase in efficiency with respect to the baseline case, due to the increased heat exchange coefficient and better matching of the bottoming cycle with the engine. More heat is expected to be recovered, with consequent increase of the overall produced power.

** Split-cycle configuration with waste heat recovery
A different engine configuration will be considered in this case. The concept is based on a split-cycle engine that divides the four strokes in two different chambers, allowing an increased energy density and efficiency with respect to conventional Otto thermodynamic cycle.

The idea is to compare a bottoming cycle with a different and theoretically more efficient engine design, especially suited to be used in hybrid cars and plug-in vehicles.

- *Modeling methodology and assumptions*
A new model will be written for this engine, and information are yet to be discussed. The model will not be a dynamic one, because of the limited time available. It will be optimized for a couple of operating points, representing the use as a range extender for a plug-in hybrid vehicle.

- *Expected results*
This engine concept is expected to show efficiencies in the order of 52 - 60 % (according to "A comparative study between a Rankine cycle and a novel intra-cycle based waste heat recovery concepts applied to an internal combustion engine" - Morgan, Dong, Panesar, Heikal and "A thermodynamic analysis ofa novel high efficiency reciprocating internal combustion engineâ€”the isoengine"  - Coney, Linnemann, Abdallah) then higher than the two combinations considered before. Introducing a bottoming cycle in this engine concept will be explored to evaluate whether further improvements are possible.
